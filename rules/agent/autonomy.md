title: "Agent Autonomy"
---

An agent that writes code closes its OWN loop against the gates. The machine
enforces correctness; the human judges design.

## The loop

1. Write the code AND its tests.
2. Run **`just check`**. No justfile → `lefthook run pre-commit --all-files && lefthook run pre-push --all-files`.
3. Read the failure, fix the ROOT CAUSE, re-run until green.
4. Once the block stands alone — **before pushing** — run the Tier 3 recipes the
   repo has: `just code-review` **first**, then `just mutate-diff`. Review costs
   minutes and can send a whole block back to the drawing board; mutation costs tens
   of them and would have measured code the redesign deletes. Kill survivors that
   deserve it (`testing/ratchet.md`), fix `CRITICAL`, loop to 2.
5. Hand back only after a **fresh green run**. Belief is not permission. Do not
   trust a prior run's claim — re-run and read the exit code.

Cadence — none of these is "wait for the human" or "wait for the PR":

| When | Command | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Per iteration | `just check` (Tier 1-2) | fmt, lint, tests, deny — seconds |
| Per sprint, before push | `just code-review` | judgment a gate cannot make — minutes |
| Per sprint, before push | `just mutate-diff` | do the tests *assert*? — tens of minutes |
| Per push | CI | a **witness**, same tools on the PR diff |

**The coherent block is the sprint**, not the task. Say it plainly because the
drift is one-way: a loop that commits per task starts running Tier 3 per task, and
then Tier 3 is a tax somebody eventually removes. And the two Tier 3 recipes are
not one thing — review is minutes, mutation is tens of minutes. Splitting them is
what lets the cheap half stay frequent when the expensive half cannot.

`just code-review` writes `.work/review-report.md`. `just review-guard` (pre-push,
no LLM) reads it. Marker rules: `.dev/kit/common/review-guard.mjs`.

**Detect, never assume.** Tier 3 is sometimes absent (`just --list`):

- recipe present → running it is part of "done";
- recipe absent → say so in the hand-back. Never silently skip, never assume green.
  No report → `review-guard` passes and tells you to declare it.

## Authority

A green gate is permission for **code**. An agent or review opinion is a proposal.
A green gate never settles a **decision** — that line is `agent/decisions.md`.

## One tree, one writer

`.work/` (review report, worklist) is per-tree. Two sessions in one checkout
share one verdict: A's `CLEAN` authorises B's push. **One tree, one writer, one
branch, one worklist.**

Parallel work gets a parallel tree, at a path you do not have to remember:

```bash
just tree <capability-slug>     # prints the path; one tree per capability
just tree-rm <capability-slug>  # tree AND branch, at the merge, in one act
```

Every tree on the machine lives under one root (`$CR_WORKTREES`, default
`~/.worktrees/<repo>/<slug>`) — outside every repo, because a checkout nested in a
repo is one every tool scans. **One tree per capability, one branch per sprint
inside it**: `.work/<capability-slug>/` is per-tree and holds that capability's plan
and all its worklists, so any other split puts one work unit in two trees.

**Parallelise across capabilities, never across the sprints of one.** A sprint is a
vertical slice, so two sprints of the same capability traverse the same layers and
collide by construction — `Blocked by` in the plan serialises the dependent ones,
and the rest are independent as promises, not as files.

The tree dies with the work. `tree-rm` removes nothing unless the tree is clean and
the branch is merged, so a forest of detached branches is something you have to
build on purpose. `just status` reports every tree; it never gates.

The human is a writer too. When they edit the tree a loop owns — legitimate, and
declared as a `human:` line in `## Log` (`skills/loop-setup`) — that line is a
**fact about the tree**, not an item to redo or undo. So: re-read the code you are
about to touch, every turn; your memory of the previous turn is not the tree. And
**never revert a change you cannot explain** — a tree that contradicts the
worklist is an escalation, not a merge conflict to resolve on your own.

## Never fake green

- **Hard — never bypass; escalate.** Correctness, security, `secret-scan`,
  behavioral tests. No `--no-verify`, no disabling a gate, no `#[ignore]` /
  `.skip`, no weakening an assertion. Same for excluding a mutant you could
  kill, lowering a ratchet baseline, or hand-editing `.work/review-report.md`.
  Cannot fix the cause → **STOP and ask**. The green must be true.
- **Soft — traced bypass allowed.** Minor style/lint only, with a justification
  comment on the same line. No bare `#[allow]` / `eslint-disable` / `# noqa` /
  `# type: ignore`.

The git floor (`lefthook`) and the harness layer (`kit/common/hooks/`, opt-in)
make bypass expensive and loud, not impossible. Wiring:
`.dev/kit/common/hooks/README.md`. This rule is still the rule.

**Declare every bypass.** No silent TODO, skipped test, placeholder, or stub.

**Escalate in that tree's `.work/<slug>/tasks/NN-*.md` → `## Blocked on the human`** —
what `just status` surfaces. Never in the review report.
